# WIP: Sofle Mario Theme Keyboard Settings with IBM PC/AT Layout

> Configured only for macOS.

This is a fork of default keymap of Sofle. Layout is highly close to **BM PC/AT** layout since my primary keyboard is HHKB.

## Encoders

### ENCODER_RESOLUTION Setting
Some encoders' resolution may need to be set to `4`, otherwise the encoders will double action per tick.

On file `qmk_firmware/keyboards/sofle/rev1/config.h`, you may need to change following setting to `4`.

```C
#define ENCODER_RESOLUTION 4
```

## Layouts
