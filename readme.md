# Sofle Mario Theme Keyboard Settings with HHKB-like Layout

This is a fork of default keymap of Sofle. Layout is highly close to **HHKB** layout since my primary keyboard is HHKB.

## OLED Features
- Left Screen
  - A jumping mushroom while CAPS LOCK
  - Show current layer
  - Show currently pressed key
- Right Screen
  - Mario game animation with WPM information (originally forked and rescaled for 128x32 OLED display from https://github.com/b0rv3g4r4/Kyria-Mario-Keymap/)
